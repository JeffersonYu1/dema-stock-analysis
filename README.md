## About
Disclaimer: This program is purely for educational purposes. It should not be considered as professional financial investment advice.

### Features
The program was written to analyze the stock performance using the Double Exponential Moving Average (DEMA) indicator. When the long-term DEMA rises above the short-term DEMA, the program marks a time to buy. When the long-term DEMA sinks below the short-term DEMA, the program marks a time to sell. Testing was done for 

This project was an exercise in using APIs, namely the Alpaca API, as well as numpy, pandas, and matplotlib in Python.

Sample graph generated by Matplotlib and sample trading details:

### Future Work
The Python script could be modified to run in real-time, making trades through the Alpaca API based on the indicator.
